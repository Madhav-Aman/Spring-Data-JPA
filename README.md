# PagingAndSortingRepository Sorting Implementation README

## Introduction
This README provides an overview of how sorting is implemented in the PagingAndSortingRepository interface in Spring Data and explains how to create a Sort object for sorting data in your Spring Data application.

## Sorting in PagingAndSortingRepository Interface
The PagingAndSortingRepository interface in Spring Data provides built-in support for sorting data retrieved from a data source. Sorting can be applied to queries for retrieving data from the repository based on one or more properties of the domain objects.

## How Sorting Works
When using the PagingAndSortingRepository interface, sorting is typically applied by passing a Sort object to the repository methods. This Sort object specifies the properties by which the data should be sorted and the direction (ascending or descending) of the sorting.

## Creating a Sort Object
To create a Sort object in Spring Data, follow these steps:

1. **Using Static Factory Methods**: Spring Data provides static factory methods in the Sort class to create Sort objects conveniently. These methods allow you to specify the properties to sort by and the sorting direction. For example:
   ```java
   import org.springframework.data.domain.Sort;

   Sort.by(Sort.Direction.ASC, "propertyName");
